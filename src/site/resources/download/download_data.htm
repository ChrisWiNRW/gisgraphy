<h2>download server</h2>
<p>If you are interesting in downloading data you can go to :
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://download.gisgraphy.com">Gisgraphy download server</a>. You will find 
	<ul>
		<li> The raw OpenStreetMap <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format" target="gisgraph">PBF</a> files split by country</i>
		<li> All the streets, cities, point of interests, and house numbers from OpenStreetMap and converted in CSV format to ease the import.
	  There is one file per country and a file with all the countries. In addition to the native OpenStreetMap data, some pre-calculated fields (length, middle point) are added to the CSV format.</li>
		<li> The shapes of more than 160,000 cities and localities extracted from <a href="http://quattroshapes.com/">Quatroshapes</a> with associated geonames Id</li>
	</ul>
