<h1>Gisgraphy Donations and Benefactors</h1>
<p>Providing the free services costs money every month - and more and more people use them. You can support my work on Gisgraphy by making a donation via PayPal.<br/>
 Gisgraphy lives with your donations; it helps us to buy more servers for greater performance.
 <br/>Many thanks in advance.<br/><br/>
